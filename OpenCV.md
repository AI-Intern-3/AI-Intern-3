These functions collectively support a wide range of tasks in AI projects, from basic image preprocessing and feature extraction to advanced object detection, tracking, and deep learning-based inference.

Certainly! Here's a simplified Python code representation using OpenCV for a basic real-time face detection example:

```python
import cv2

# Load pre-trained Haar cascade for face detection
face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')

# Open a video capture object (0 for default camera)
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    # Read a frame from the camera
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    
    # Convert the frame to grayscale for detection
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    
    # Detect faces in the grayscale frame
    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.3, minNeighbors=5)
    
    # Draw rectangles around detected faces
    for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
        cv2.rectangle(frame, (x, y), (x+w, y+h), (255, 0, 0), 2)
    
    # Display the frame with detected faces
    cv2.imshow('Face Detection', frame)
    
    # Exit the loop when 'q' is pressed
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release the video capture object and close all windows
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### Explanation:
- **Importing Libraries:** `import cv2` imports the OpenCV library.

- **Loading Cascade Classifier:** `face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(...)` loads the pre-trained Haar cascade classifier for face detection. The path `cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml'` accesses the default XML file for frontal face detection.

- **Opening Video Capture:** `cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)` initializes a video capture object (`cap`) for the default camera (index 0).

- **Main Loop (`while True`):**
  - `ret, frame = cap.read()` reads a frame from the video capture object.
  - `gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)` converts the frame to grayscale for better processing.
  - `faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.3, minNeighbors=5)` detects faces in the grayscale frame using the Haar cascade classifier.
  - `for (x, y, w, h) in faces:` iterates through the detected faces and draws rectangles around each face using `cv2.rectangle()`.

- **Displaying Frames:** `cv2.imshow('Face Detection', frame)` displays the processed frame with detected faces in a window titled 'Face Detection'.

- **Exiting the Loop:** `if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):` checks for the 'q' key press to exit the loop (`0xFF` ensures compatibility with different keyboard layouts).

- **Releasing Resources:** `cap.release()` releases the video capture object, and `cv2.destroyAllWindows()` closes all OpenCV windows.

This example demonstrates a basic real-time face detection application using OpenCV, capturing frames from the camera, detecting faces, and displaying the processed frames with rectangles around detected faces.
