### Numerical Computations

Numerical computations involve algorithms to solve mathematical problems approximately rather than analytically. Here are a few key concepts:

#### Example: Solving Equations Numerically
Suppose we want to find the roots of the equation \( f(x) = x^2 - 2 = 0 \). The exact solution is \( x = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 \).

One common numerical method is the **Newton-Raphson method**:
\[ x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} \]

1. Choose an initial guess, \( x_0 \).
2. Compute \( x_1 = x_0 - \frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)} \).
3. Repeat until the desired accuracy is achieved.

#### Example Implementation in Python:
```python
def f(x):
    return x**2 - 2

def f_prime(x):
    return 2 * x

x_n = 1.0  # initial guess
tolerance = 1e-10

while abs(f(x_n)) > tolerance:
    x_n = x_n - f(x_n) / f_prime(x_n)

print(f"The root is approximately: {x_n}")
```

### Linear Algebra Operations

Linear algebra deals with vectors, matrices, and linear transformations.

#### Example: Solving a System of Linear Equations
Given a system of equations:
\[ 
\begin{cases}
2x + 3y = 5 \\
4x + y = 6 
\end{cases}
\]

We can represent this system as:
\[ AX = B \]
where \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( B = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} \).

To solve for \( X = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \), we can use matrix operations:
\[ X = A^{-1}B \]

#### Example Implementation in Python:
```python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[2, 3], [4, 1]])
B = np.array([5, 6])

X = np.linalg.solve(A, B)
print(f"The solution is x = {X[0]}, y = {X[1]}")
```

### Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis involves collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data to draw conclusions.

#### Example: Descriptive Statistics
Given a dataset: \([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\)

We can calculate:
- **Mean**: \(\mu = \frac{1+2+3+4+5}{5} = 3\)
- **Variance**: \(\sigma^2 = \frac{(1-3)^2 + (2-3)^2 + (3-3)^2 + (4-3)^2 + (5-3)^2}{5} = 2\)
- **Standard Deviation**: \(\sigma = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414\)

#### Example Implementation in Python:
```python
import numpy as np

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

mean = np.mean(data)
variance = np.var(data)
std_dev = np.std(data)

print(f"Mean: {mean}, Variance: {variance}, Standard Deviation: {std_dev}")
```

### Fourier Transforms

Fourier transforms decompose a function (signal) into its constituent frequencies.

#### Example: Fourier Transform of a Signal
Suppose we have a signal \( f(t) = \cos(2\pi t) + \cos(4\pi t) \).

The Fourier transform converts this time-domain signal into the frequency domain, showing the frequencies present in the signal.

#### Example Implementation in Python:
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Time domain signal
t = np.linspace(0, 1, 400)
signal = np.cos(2 * np.pi * t) + np.cos(4 * np.pi * t)

# Compute Fourier Transform
frequency_domain = np.fft.fft(signal)
frequencies = np.fft.fftfreq(len(t), d=t[1] - t[0])

# Plot the signal
plt.subplot(2, 1, 1)
plt.plot(t, signal)
plt.title("Time Domain Signal")

# Plot the Fourier Transform (magnitude)
plt.subplot(2, 1, 2)
plt.plot(frequencies, np.abs(frequency_domain))
plt.title("Frequency Domain Signal")
plt.show()
```

Each of these examples demonstrates how these mathematical concepts can be implemented and applied using Python, making it easier to perform complex computations and analyses.
